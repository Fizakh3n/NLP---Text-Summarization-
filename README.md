# NLP-Text-Summarization-
📝 Text Summarization Using NLP – Project Overview<br>
<br>
🌟Objective:<br>
•Built a text summarization system to condense lengthy articles into concise summaries while retaining core information.<br>
<br>
🔍 Operations Performed<br>
•Data Handling & Preprocessing:<br>
Loaded article datasets (news, blogs, etc.) and cleaned text (lowercase, punctuation removal).<br>
Removed stopwords and performed tokenization and stemming.<br>
<br>
Modeling Techniques:<br>
•Extractive Summarization: Identified key sentences based on frequency of important terms.<br>
•Abstractive Summarization: Generated novel summaries using Transformer-based models like BERT/GPT.<br>
•Evaluated ROUGE scores to measure summary quality.<br>

📈 Key Insights & Impacts<br>
•Performance Metrics:<br>
•Achieved high ROUGE scores, indicating summary accuracy.<br>
•Extractive approach retained 85-90% of original meaning, while abstractive methods produced concise summaries.<br>
Impact:<br>
📊 Improved content delivery by providing quick, meaningful summaries to users.<br>

Practical Applications:
<br>
•Useful for news aggregation platforms and content curation websites.<br>
•Potential to enhance SEO performance by summarizing web content efficiently.<br>
Impact:<br>
🚀 Adds value to platforms requiring real-time article summarization.<br>
<br>
🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used<br>
